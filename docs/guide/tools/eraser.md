# Eraser tool

The eraser tool can remove strokes or parts of strokes. It has three modes:

- **Standard**: remove parts of strokes that the cursor moves over.
- **Whiteout**: paint a white stroke on top of what you want to hide. This is useful if you want to erase something from the background.
- **Delete Stroke**: remove the entirety of any stroke that the cursor touches.
